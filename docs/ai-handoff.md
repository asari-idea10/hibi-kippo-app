# AI Handoff

Last updated: 2026-07-09

This file is the shared handoff log for Codex, ChatGPT, and Gemini.

## Agent Roles

### Suggested

- Codex: codebase investigation, implementation, local verification, concise handoff notes.
- ChatGPT: specification drafting, wording, review of TODOs and product decisions.
- Gemini: secondary review, long-context comparison, source/reference cross-checking.

These roles are operational suggestions, not product requirements.

## Handoff Rules

- Separate confirmed specification, current code behavior, and TODOs.
- Do not treat unexplained current behavior as final specification.
- Do not change fortune/calendar logic by inference.
- For implementation changes, record changed files, verification, and unresolved issues.

## Share Packet For Other AIs

When handing this project to ChatGPT or Gemini, include:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `docs/product-spec.md`
- `docs/fortune-rules.md`
- `docs/url-parameters.md`
- `docs/decision-log.md`
- The specific code files being reviewed, not the whole repository by default.
- A clear instruction to preserve the distinction between confirmed specification, current code behavior, and TODO.

## Current Baseline Handoff

Date: 2026-07-09

Summary:

- Created baseline documentation for AI-assisted development.
- No feature, UI, or fortune/calendar logic changes are intended in this documentation pass.
- The current focus is documenting `purpose-calendar`, URL parameters, candidate flow, and future agent rules.

Changed files:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `docs/product-spec.md`
- `docs/fortune-rules.md`
- `docs/screen-design.md`
- `docs/url-parameters.md`
- `docs/ai-handoff.md`
- `docs/decision-log.md`
- `docs/task-board.md`
- `docs/review-checklist.md`

Verification:

- Documentation-only change.
- `git diff -- src` returned no feature-code diff.
- `git status --short` shows only `AGENTS.md` and new files under `docs/`.

Unresolved:

- See TODO sections in each document.
- Highest-priority open decisions are listed in `docs/decision-log.md`.
- Prioritized implementation candidates are listed in `docs/task-board.md`.
